# Insert: A (potentially) great editor for iOS

There exists few great code editors for iOS — I've tried them all. My current favorites are [GoCoEdit](http://gocoedit.com) and [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/). 

This project is an experiment, to see how hard it is to throw something together that is reasonable. Most attempts at doing so are pathetic, so I'd like to take a shot at it. The app, if ever finished, will be free, as in freedom.

Help would be much appreciated, as the only iOS development I have ever done is with the LOVE2D Framework. 

## Inteneded Workflow

- iOS 11 Files integration, so you can edit files from any source with this application.
- SFTP Workflow, as this seems to be the best. 
- Potential collaboration with [Blink](http://www.blink.sh), for launching terminal connections from the editor. 

## Intended Enhancements

- Visible Whitespace/Invisibles Option.
- TextMate Themes Support.
- Arbitrary Fonts Support (e.g. AnyFont or custom profiles)
- Multiple views at the same time (e.g. split view w/ *⌘D*)
- Search through files (e.g. *⌘T*). 
- iCloud sync for configuration.

## Technologies

- This project will mostly likely be written in Swift, and utilize a number of open source libraries that are available.
- Much inspiration will be taken from the excellent [GoCoEdit](http://gocoedit.com) project, as well as [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).
